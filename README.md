This is a proof of concept of one of the oldest incentive in the world.

> **Buy one, get two.**

If you ever went to a supermarket, you saw every shape or form of that concept. ðŸ¦¥

The goal is to bring this concept to the crypto space multichain verse.

### Diary

Keep it stupid simple.

The goal is to make something on one chain and do something on another chain.

Learn some XCM implentation meanwhile would be amazing, but could be lend out of scope.
Lets see ðŸ¦¥

#### Currently I think about:

1. Mint something on Chain A
2. If minted, a extrinstic on Chain B gets called.
3. If minted, a extrinstic on Chain C gets called.

#### In more concret steps.

- [x] Make a UI.
- [x] Code a Frontend.
- [ ] Make Buttons do something.
  - [ ] Make `Chain A Button` do something
  - [ ] Make `Chain B Button` do something
  - [ ] Make `Chain C Button` do something
- [ ] Make Smart Contract.
- [ ] LOOK AT THE CLOOCK

#### Figma

- [x] [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/GLshGEMxcTxy423xP9OG24/Untitled?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=sX5MFYcgAVUmbXyf-1)

#### Code Frontend

- [x] `pnpm create vite@latest --template typescript`]
- [x] make 3 divs. Each div has 1 button & 1 picture. Style them.

#### Local Enviorment ?!
