This is a proof of concept of one of the oldest incentive in the world.

> **Buy one, get two.**

If you ever went to a supermarket, you saw every shape or form of that concept. ðŸ¦¥

The goal is to bring this concept to the crypto space multichain verse.

### Diary

Keep it stupid simple.

The goal is to make something on one chain and do something on another chain.

Learn some XCM implentation meanwhile would be amazing, but could be lend out of scope.
Lets see ðŸ¦¥

#### Added after Deadline:

Summary:

- [x] Figure out how to make one XCM Transaction
- [x] Figure out a simplistic Layout for proof the concept.
- [x] Code the concept out.
- [ ] Replicate it thruh polkadot JS
- [x] Change Plan. 
- [x] Write Steps down to do, to make something happen.
- [x] Style it.

#### Currently I think about:

1. Mint something on Chain A
2. If minted, a extrinstic on Chain B gets called.
3. If minted, a extrinstic on Chain C gets called.

#### In more concret steps.

- [x] Make a UI.
- [x] Code a Frontend.
- [ ] Make Buttons do something.
  - [ ] Make `Chain A Button` do something
  - [ ] Make `Chain B Button` do something
  - [ ] Make `Chain C Button` do something
- [ ] Make Smart Contract.
- [ ] LOOK AT THE CLOOCK

#### Figma

- [x] [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/GLshGEMxcTxy423xP9OG24/Untitled?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=sX5MFYcgAVUmbXyf-1)

#### Code Frontend

- [x] `pnpm create vite@latest --template typescript`]
- [x] make 3 divs. Each div has 1 button & 1 picture. Style them.

#### Local Enviorment

> This will not happen, change directions. Got errors for zombienet.

- [ ] Simulate a Parachain Network

#### Change Scope, Idea

The goal is to make a Roadmap of success.

My road to Buy one get two.
