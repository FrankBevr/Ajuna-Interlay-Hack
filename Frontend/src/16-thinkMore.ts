    Ok now we know some stuff.
    So the question remains.
    How do I make a button, which allows you to buy an NFT and you get another Asset for free on another chain.
    XCM feels like a promising way to achieve it.
    But it could be that I need chain extension in the contract to even make it work and bring the whole logic into the digital asset itself.
